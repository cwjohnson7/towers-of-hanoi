  <h2>Towers of Hanoi</h2>
  <body>
    <p>
      <li>
        We'll use your Chrome Browser JavaScript Console to play the game. We'll
        want to be able to print the board horizontally. You MUST utilize a map
        function at least once to accomplish this part of the assignment. The
        starting board will log the 2D array to the console like this:
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Our game will progress with the player submitting moves to the game and
        the game accepting or rejecting the move and updating the board if the
        move is allowed. Remember, you must only move the top disc from the peg
        and you can't move a disc on top of another if it is bigger than that
        disc. For example, with moves originating from the above starting board:
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        There should be an object responsible for maintaining the state of the
        board.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>There should be a way to move discs from one peg to another.</li>
      <br />
      <li>
        There should be a checkWinner function that checks to see if the player
        has won the game. You win the game by putting all the discs back in the
        original order but on a new peg.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Once a player wins, the game should automatically end by announcing the
        winner (through a console log) and reset for a new game.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        As a bonus, any time you iterate through an array, try and refrain from
        using for or while loops - instead try to use the Array helper methods.
      </li>
